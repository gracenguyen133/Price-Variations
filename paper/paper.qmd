# Introduction

In recent years, specialty products such as sourdough bread have changed the retail food market with significant pricing transformations. In Toronto's dynamic retail environment, Loblaws, Metro, NoFrills, Walmart, and Voila, among others, have taken different routes in serving premium product pricing. Retail pricing strategies have been extensively researched, but the precise dynamic of how specialty bread is priced (or priced below) staple food items and above premium items in urban markets is not well understood, and its lack of understanding is notably absent in the case of different types of retailer positioning these products.

Our estimand is the relationship between retailer characteristics and sourdough bread pricing in Toronto's market, measured through average price per 100g across different vendor categories and periods from February to July 2024. In particular, we analyze how prices differ from, but condition on, brand effects and product characteristics between major retail chains.

We exploit daily price tracking data and Bayesian logistic regression analysis to uncover sharp intervener differences in prices (R² = 0.841) and systematic pricing patterns. Premium vendors such as Loblaws (on average $1.956 per 100g) prices are consistently higher than discount retailers like NoFrills (averaged $0.553 per 100g), with distinct price variability patterns over time. The findings of deliberate market positioning through pricing strategies instead of cost-based pricing would seem to indicate.

These findings have significant implications for understanding segmentation and consumer choice in the retail market of urban food markets. The price variations we discover are significant, supporting the argument that retailers employ specialty bread products as a market positioning tool for consumers considering comparable price differences, retailers exploring pricing strategy, and policymakers regarding food access and market competition.

In the remaining part of this paper, we describe the dataset and measurement approach, including the details of our price-tracking methodology and data-cleaning procedure (@sec-data). In section 3, we present our Bayesian logistic regression model and our estimation strategy. In section 4, we present our empirical results and analysis of pricing patterns. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings, limitations, and directions for future research in Section 5.


# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

In this analysis, we work with daily price data of sourdough white bread available from five major retailers in Toronto between February and July 2024, collected from Project Hammer [@filipp_2024_project]. Standardized analysis is possible due to the densely packed dataset, which includes extensive pricing information measured in dollars per 100g across different package sizes and vendors. The statistical programming language R [@rcoreteam_2024_r] is used to perform the analysis, accompanied by the explicative packages for data manipulation tidyverse [@wickham_2019_welcome], Bayesian regression analysis rstanarm [@goodrich_2023_bayesian], and visualization ggplot2 [@wickham_2016_create]. For efficient data storage and retrieval, we use the Arrow R Package [@apachearrowdevelopers_2023_arrow] that delivers optimized data performance for large datasets and provides predictability of our analysis. The dataset includes 1,485 price observations made at Loblaws, Metro, NoFrills, Walmart, and Voila and thus offers a rich sample on which to analyze price patterns. The retail price, the vendor information (supplier’s name, city, location, telephone number), date of collection, and brand details are included in each observation for a extensive study of pricing strategies through different markets and periods.

```

## Measurement
	
Systematic daily tracking of sourdough white bread prices in Toronto's major retail outlets is the primary data collection methodology. In other words, Project Hammer [@filipp_2024_project] follows a standard data collection methodology by recording prices from Loblaws, Metro, NoFrills, Walmart, and Voila online and through in-store displays. All prices are standardized to dollars per 100g, removing the effects of differing package sizes, retailers, and brands. This standardization is explicative since package sizes vary from 450g to 800g, and direct price comparisons could be misleading without conversion.

The price observation consists of capturing several other vital variables. We take the standardized price per 100g as our primary variable of interest. Additional variables are the vendor name, which we categorize as either premium retailers (Loblaws, Metro) or discount retailers (NoFrills, Walmart) based on their market positioning and pricing strategies. Furthermore, we record temporal variables such as the observation date to examine price fluctuations over the period and spot any seasonal or weekly price behavior in the pricing strategy.

Our approach to measuring and tracking price variations draws parallels to methods used in tracking agricultural commodity prices [@barnett_2007_weather], adapting systematic daily monitoring techniques to the retail context. Several measures were taken to ensure data quality and reliability during the data collection and cleaning process. We also consider missing data points (stock unavailability or technical issues on online platforms) that occasionally pop up, and we make sure to document clearly and ignore them during the analysis to maintain clean data. Vendor price anomalies are flagged with verification flags to identify potential data entry errors or genuine short-term price fluctuations where values exceed three standard deviations from their respective mean price. Regular spot checks are done to verify that the prices on these channels for the vendors with both online and in-store presence are consistent.

## Outcome variables

Our primary outcome variable is the standardized price per 100g of sourdough white bread. For pricing analysis from Feb to July 2024, our results show wide price variation between retailers - from $0.37 to $3.75 a 100g. @fig-price-dist shows the distribution of these prices between different vendors, demonstrated by the discrepancy between premium and discount retailers.

```{r}

ggplot(analysis_data, 
       aes(x = vendor, y = price_per_100g, fill = vendor)) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")
```

Several patterns are notable in the pricing distribution, as seen from the boxplots @fig-price-dist. The highest median and most considerable prices spread across Loblaws suggest a dynamic pricing strategy, responding to market conditions and competition. NoFrills, on the other hand, is lower and more focused on price distribution, which is consistent with its strong discount retailer positioning. Walmart and Metro display intermediate pricing levels, and although Metro's distribution is skewed higher in line with its more premium market positioning, its pricing is consistent with the premium evaluation of quality products. Outliers' presence, especially in Loblaws and Metro's distribution, suggests that standard pricing occasionally deviates significantly from it, thus either due to promotional activities or supply chain fluctuations.


Several key features of temporal evolution are revealed in the price distribution. Mean $1.96 per 100g at premium vendors (Loblaws) compared with standard $0.553 per 100g at discount vendors (NoFrills). As shown in @fig-price-time, these prices show how consistent price differentials between vendors exist alongside erratic price stability over time.

  )

# Print the plot
print(vendor_trends)
```


@fig-price-time suggests that vendors have different pricing strategies, with Loblaws displaying the highest price levels and most extraordinary volatility, particularly in June and July, likely related to adjustments to market dynamics. Second, Metro, also considered a premium retailer, is relatively stable, though it is higher priced than discount retailers. On the other hand, Walmart and NoFrills are consistently low and stable with little/no change in price and should be viewed as a value strategy. These trends imply that dynamic pricing exists for premium retailers in order to take advantage of potential market playing fields and price stability for discount retailers in an attempt to cater to their cost-conscious customers. The divergence in pricing strategies draws attention to the significance of monetizing market positioning and consumer perception.


@tbl-price-summary provides extensive summary statistics of our price data, including means, standard deviations, and ranges for each vendor category. These statistics reveal not only the differences in price levels but also in price volatility across different market segments.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-price-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics of sourdough bread prices by vendor, showing systematic differences in pricing strategies across retailers."
#| tbl-pos: "H"
#| tbl-align: "center"
#| echo: false

price_summary <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(vendor) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_price = mean(price_per_100g),
    sd_price = sd(price_per_100g),
    min_price = min(price_per_100g),
    max_price = max(price_per_100g)
  )

knitr::kable(
  price_summary, 
  digits = 2,
  col.names = c("Vendor", "Mean Price ($)", "SD ($)", "Min Price ($)", "Max Price ($)"),
  align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")  # Align columns (l=left, c=center)
) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    position = "center",
    latex_options = c("hold_position"),
    full_width = FALSE
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Price Statistics" = 4))
```

@tbl-price-summary summarizes the price strategy with deeper statistics. The standard deviation values are particularly revealing as premium retailers displayed significant variability in their pricing. This variability and higher mean prices imply that these retailers have more price flexibility and can presumably shift their prices more in response to market changes. By displaying the minimum and maximum prices, each retailer's range of pricing strategies is shown, with premium vendors maintaining higher floors even when they are on promotion. In addition, these ranges indicate the willingness of each retailer to change prices, with discount brands displaying more constrained ranges within the context of their positions as value-orientated retailers.


Patterns in @fig-price-dist and @fig-price-time, and the summary statistics in @tbl-price-summary, indicate that there is significant price dispersion across and within vendors, which implies that pricing strategies in Toronto's sourdough bread market are not a function of essential cost alone. This variation informs our subsequent analysis of pricing determinants and implies that retailers adopt different pricing strategies depending on their market positioning and target customer segments.


## Predictor variables

To model variations in sourdough bread prices, we included several predictors capturing vendor characteristics, temporal trends, and product attributes. These variables were chosen to reflect factors that influence pricing strategies and consumer perception. Below, we describe each predictor and its anticipated impact on bread prices.

### Vendor
Vendor is a categorical variable representing the retailer (e.g., Loblaws, Metro, Walmart, NoFrills, Voila). Retailers are classified as either premium or discount vendors. Premium vendors like Loblaws and Metro are expected to charge higher prices due to their market positioning and perceived product quality, while discount vendors like NoFrills and Walmart focus on affordability.

```{r}
#| label: fig-vendor-prices
#| fig-cap: "Average price per 100g of sourdough bread by vendor, highlighting differences between premium and discount retailers."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

ggplot(analysis_data_clean, aes(x = vendor, y = price_per_100g, fill = vendor)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(title = "Average Price by Vendor",
       x = "Vendor",
       y = "Average Price per 100g ($)")
```

As shown in @fig-vendor-prices, premium vendors such as Loblaws have consistently higher prices compared to discount vendors like NoFrills and Walmart.

### Date

Date is a numerical variable that represents the time of observation, converted into a numeric format. This predictor captures temporal price trends such as seasonal effects or dynamic pricing strategies over time. The interaction between Date and Vendor accounts for vendor-specific adjustments over the study period.

@fig-temporal-trends reveals that premium vendors like Loblaws show significant temporal variation in prices, while discount vendors maintain more stable pricing over time.

```{r}
#| label: fig-temporal-trends
#| fig-cap: "Temporal trends in price per 100g by vendor, showing seasonal variation and pricing dynamics."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-pos: "H"
#| fig-align: "center"

ggplot(analysis_data_clean, aes(x = date, y = price_per_100g, color = vendor)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(title = "Temporal Price Trends by Vendor",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Price per 100g ($)")
```

### Brand

Brand is a categorical variable identifying the specific bread brand. Premium brands are expected to command higher prices due to their perceived quality and reputation. As seen in @tbl-brand-summary, brand significantly influences price levels across vendors.


```{r}
#| label: tbl-brand-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of prices per 100g by brand, showing mean and standard deviation."
#| tbl-pos: "H"
#| tbl-align: "center"
#| echo: false

analysis_data_clean <- analysis_data_clean %>%
  filter(!str_detect(brand, "error|http"))

brand_summary <- analysis_data_clean %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_price = mean(price_per_100g, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_price = sd(price_per_100g, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

knitr::kable(
  brand_summary,
  digits = 2,
  col.names = c("Brand", "Mean Price ($)", "SD ($)"),
  align = c("l", "c", "c") # Left-align Brand, Center-align Mean Price and SD
) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    position = "center",
    latex_options = c("hold_position"),
    full_width = FALSE
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Price Statistics" = 2))
```


### Product Type

Product Type is a categorical variable derived from product descriptions, classified into three categories:

- Artisan: High-end, handcrafted bread expected to have the highest prices.

- Sliced: Pre-sliced bread, often mass-produced with moderate pricing.

- Regular: Standard bread with lower price points.

```{r}
#| label: fig-product-type-prices
#| fig-cap: "Average price per 100g by product type, showing significant price differences among artisan, sliced, and regular bread."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

# Create product type classification and remove outliers
analysis_data_clean <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    product_type = case_when(
      str_detect(tolower(product), "artisan|artesano") ~ "artisan",
      str_detect(tolower(product), "sliced") ~ "sliced",
      TRUE ~ "regular"
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(abs(price_per_100g - mean(price_per_100g)) <= 3 * sd(price_per_100g))

ggplot(analysis_data_clean, aes(x = product_type, y = price_per_100g, fill = product_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  labs(title = "Price by Product Type",
       x = "Product Type",
       y = "Average Price per 100g ($)")
```

@fig-product-type-prices illustrates the variation in prices across these product categories.


### Grams (Package Size)

Grams represents the package size of the product in grams. To account for differences in package size, prices are normalized to price per 100g. Larger packages generally have lower per-unit prices due to economies of scale, as shown in @fig-grams-vs-price.

```{r}
#| label: fig-grams-vs-price
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between package size and price per 100g, showing economies of scale in larger packages."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

ggplot(analysis_data_clean, aes(x = grams, y = price_per_100g)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Price per 100g vs Package Size",
       x = "Package Size (grams)",
       y = "Price per 100g ($)")
```

# Model

The goal of our modeling strategy is twofold. First, to investigate the causal effect of vendor characteristics on the price of sourdough bread while controlling for product attributes using the approach in the retail pricing literature, including @dellavigna_2019_uniform and @ellickson_2008_supermarket. Second, we will see how these relationships evolve and differ across different segments based on Kaplan's theoretical framework of relative price dispersion (@kaplan_2019_relative).

## Model set-up

We apply a Bayesian linear regression model to analyze the price variations following the retail price analysis approach suggested by @dubois_2010_price. Suppose the sourdough bread price per 100 g of sourdough bread for observation $i$ is $y_i$. Our model specification, inspired by the price-setting framework of @nakamura_2011_price, is:  

\begin{align}
y_i \mid \mu_i, \sigma &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Vendor}_i + \beta_2 \text{Date}_i + \beta_3 \text{Brand}_i \\
     &\quad + \beta_4 \text{ProductType}_i + \beta_5 \text{Grams}_i + \gamma (\text{Vendor}_i \times \text{Date}_i) \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(1.5, 0.5) \\
\beta_k &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \quad \text{for } k \in \{1, \dots, 5\} \\
\gamma &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \text{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( y_i \): Observed price per 100 g of sourdough bread for observation \( i \).
    \item \( \mu_i \): Predicted mean price for observation \( i \).
    \item \( \alpha \): Intercept term representing the baseline price, with a prior centered at 1.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5.
    \item \( \beta_k \): Coefficients representing the effects of predictors (Vendor, Date, Brand, Product Type, and Grams), each with a prior centered at 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    \item \( \gamma \): Interaction effect between Vendor and Date, with a prior centered at 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5.
    \item \( \sigma \): Residual standard deviation, following an Exponential(1) distribution.
\end{itemize}

We implement this model using R [@rcoreteam_2024_r] with the rstanarm package [@goodrich_2023_bayesian]. The model incorporates results derived from @seiler_2017_the regarding the importance of market positioning in retail pricing strategies. Model results are presented using the modelsummary package [@arelbundock_2022_bmodelsummaryb], which provides standardized and reproducible methods for presenting statistical output in R.


### Model justification

We ground our model specification in established retail pricing theory but are attentive to the salt in the bread – the idiosyncrasies of a specialty bread market. Normal distribution for prices aligns with standard modeling assumptions for retail prices in @dellavigna_2019_uniform due to continuous price history and normal asymmetries in the movement around a market equilibrium.

Given documented differences in pricing strategies between premium and discount retailers, the fact that the $\beta_1$ coefficient captures the incorporation of vendor-specific effects is significant. We also find that @basker_2007_the's research on retail market segments shows that different retail categories systematically keep different price levels accordingly to serve different market segments, so we follow @basker_2007_the. Regarding supermarket pricing behavior, @ellickson_2008_supermarket highlights the interaction between vendor and time ($\gamma$), i.e., how pricing strategies are dynamic.

Within our model, brand and product type effects are central, as we follow the theoretical framework established by @dubois_2010_price. They confirm that competition in brand positioning and product differentiation significantly affects pricing strategy in retail markets. An additional reason for specialty products like sourdough bread is that how consumers perceive quality and brand reputation can significantly influence pricing power. @hausman_2007_consumer demonstrates that accounting for package size effects through $\beta_5$ captures the economies of scale in price, a feature essential for explaining variation in retail prices.

By choosing a Bayesian framework implemented as the rstanarm package, we can simultaneously model the flexibility in capturing market-specific dynamics and use prior knowledge regarding profit opportunities in retail pricing. This is especially powerful given that specialty food pricing is inherently complex, and as @akerlof_2015_phishing points out, traditional market efficiency assumptions may only partially explain consumer behavior or retailer strategy. The model's ability to explain systematic pricing differences and temporal variation aligns with @nakamura_2011_price's findings on price-setting behavior in forward-looking markets.

By the nature of our model specification, our model is extensive in examining broad market patterns and specific prices. However, understanding price dispersion in urban markets, especially in specialized food markets where @kaplan_2019_relative found price differences frequently are due to strategic positioning rather than cost differences, is explicative. Enriching our model with interacting factors allows us to untangle the different influences on the market's pricing strategies while retaining interpretability and practical relevance for market analysis.

@tbl-modelresults presents our primary model results. The model explains a substantial portion of price variation (R² = 0.839), with key findings:

1. Vendor Effects:

- Metro shows a 0.03 price premium over the baseline

- NoFrills maintains significantly lower prices (-0.72)

- Voila shows moderate price elevation (0.01)

- Walmart demonstrates competitive pricing (-0.18)


2. Temporal Effects:

- Time trend coefficient (0.01) indicates slight upward price movement

- Standard error (0.00) suggests high precision in this estimate


3. Product Characteristics:

- Regular products show pricing discount (-0.01)

- Sliced varieties maintain similar pricing (0.01)

- Package size has minimal impact (0.00)

The model's performance is supported by multiple metrics:

- Log Likelihood: 1576.8

- LOOIC: 3132.5

- WAIC: 3133.4

- RMSE: 0.065 per 100g

These statistics indicate strong model fit and reliable predictive performance across different validation approaches.

The credible intervals from @fig-intervals show:

- Robust vendor effects (particularly for NoFrills)

- Precise estimation of time trends

- Moderate uncertainty in brand effects

- Well-estimated product type impacts


# Discussion

## Market Segmentation and Retail Strategy Implications

We find unique differentiation among Toronto sourdough bread retail clusters, aligned with but going beyond patterns observed by @dellavigna_2019_uniform's U.S. retail chains. Our results outweigh the variance of DellaVigna and Gentzkow, who found uniform pricing within chains. Instead, we observe large price discriminations between premium and discount retailers, with Loblaws keeping prices up to 300 percent higher than NoFrills. The price differences between stores match @ellickson_2008_supermarket's framework of strategic retail positioning, where store prices differ due to deliberate market segmenting rather than just reflecting different costs.

The persistent price differentials we observe between premium and discount vendors are consistent with @akerlof_2015_phishing's claim that retail markets often exhibit systematic price dispersion across relatively homogeneous products. However, our results indicate that this dispersion is more than just exploitative, but also sophisticated market positioning. At least, Loblaw premium vendors appear to be using sourdough bread as a signal of market position, much as is identified by @nakamura_2011_price in markets that are forward-looking for price information. 

## Dynamic Pricing and Market Competition

Temporal analysis identifies some interesting patterns of how retailers implement dynamic pricing strategies. Relative to @kaplan_2019_relative's findings on relative price dispersion in retail markets, premium vendors appear more price flexible and responsive to markets, as they are found to be more flexible in charging high prices to lower revenue products than low-price products. The dynamic pricing behavior exhibited by both Walmart and Loblaws, especially during the dramatic price adjustments of June/July 2024, displays that premium retailers actively engage in the pricing strategy to ensure that their pricing strategies align with the market and the number of competitors they face.

Contrary to that, @basker_2007_the analyzes Walmart's pricing strategies, and Walmart's pricing strategies as stable, consistently low prices as a explicative competitive advantage for the stability of discount retailers' prices. Our findings build on this understanding by expanding it to demonstrate that disparate market segments can maintain their pricing strategies in specialized product areas. The observed competitive dynamics are consistent with the @dubois_2010_price model of price and brand retailer competition in a differentiated product market.

## Consumer Choice and Market Efficiency

The sizeable and persistent price differentials we observe are questions for market efficiency and consumer choice. Our findings point to a more complex picture than the one by @hausman_2007_consumer, who documented considerable consumer benefits from retail competition. Large price differentials (averaging $1.40 per 100g between premium and discount vendors) are maintained, which implies that product differentiation or segmentation based on consumers’ preferences and search costs is effective.

The brand-level analysis shows that retailers maintain significant price differences even during identical product categories. As @seiler_2017_the finds, this pattern represents how retailers exploit brand positioning and advertising to influence consumer choice. Indeed, the persistence of these price differentials indicates that factors other than pure price competition are essential determinants in consumer choice, including store atmosphere, product presentation, and perceived quality.

## Weaknesses and next steps

Several fundamental limitations of our study deserve to be noted. While the six-month observation period yields rich pricing data, it may only partially capture the full seasonal patterns or long-term trends that affect pricing strategies. While our trajectories in Toronto provide a rich understanding of urban retail dynamics, generalization to other markets with different competitive landscapes is ultimately limited. Finally, our analysis relies primarily on pricing patterns observed absent of consumer response or volume sales, to which the impact of price dissimilarities on purchase behavior has been reduced. Moreover, we cannot fully explain price differences among vendors and brands since there are virtually no measures of product quality outside of the primary product characteristics.

Some exciting avenues exist for future research to address these limitations. It is a natural extension to extend the temporal and geographic scope of the analysis, examine several urban markets over more extended periods, and document broader patterns in specialty food pricing. Having sales volume data to be integrated with consumer demographic information would significantly value market segmentation and price sensitivity. Investigating the moderating role of store location characteristics, local competition intensity, and the increasing importance of online retail channels would be beneficial to understanding pricing dynamics. The firm proposes these expansions as extensions to a more complete model of retail pricing strategies in specialty food markets, contributing to theoretical understanding and practical applications in retail management.

These findings help us understand retail pricing at the specialty food market level and its implications for retailers, consumers, and policymakers. The evidence of market segmentation and strategic pricing behavior is clear, and the findings point to the proposition that simple models of price competition may only capture some of the complexity of the urban retail market.

## Sampling and Data Collection Methodology

Our data collection strategy followed a systematic approach to ensure extensive coverage of Toronto's sourdough bread market:

1. Temporal Sampling:
- Daily price tracking from February to July 2024

- Consistent sampling times to control for intra-day variations

- Coverage of both weekday and weekend pricing patterns

2. Vendor Selection:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-vendor-coverage
#| tbl-cap: "Vendor Coverage Analysis"

kable(vendor_patterns,
      col.names = c("Vendor", "Average Price ($)", "Unique Products", "Price Range ($)"),
      digits = 3,
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

3. Product Classification Methods:

- Standardized categorization of product types
- Consistent measurement of package sizes
- Uniform price conversion to per 100g basis

It shows that the Model Fit of the most complex model are better than other models, validating our choice for this case.

## Observational Data Considerations

1. Selection Effects:

- Analysis of vendor availability

- Product availability patterns

- Price recording consistency


2. Measurement Validation:

- Cross-validation with multiple sources

- Standard error estimation

- Systematic bias assessment


3. Sample Size Analysis:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-sample-size
#| tbl-cap: "Sample size adequacy analysis"

power_analysis <- data.frame(
  vendor = names(table(analysis_data$vendor)),
  n = as.numeric(table(analysis_data$vendor)),
  power = pnorm(sqrt(as.numeric(table(analysis_data$vendor))/4))
